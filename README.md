# SMS-Email_Spam_Classification

# ðŸ“§ SMS/Email Spam Classifier

A machine learningâ€“powered web app to classify SMS and Email messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.  
Built with **Python, scikit-learn, Streamlit**, and deployed on **Heroku** (coming soon ðŸš€).

---

##  Features
- Preprocesses input text (lowercasing, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming).
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction.
- Trained with **Multinomial Naive Bayes** (best-performing model in experiments).
- Simple **Streamlit UI** for real-time classification.
- Ready for deployment on **Heroku**.
